Limiting the frame rate to 500 FPS using clock.tick(500) does not guarantee that the game will always run at exactly 500 frames per second.
Without dt: If the frame rate drops (e.g., from 500 FPS to 250 FPS),
the game will run slower because each frame takes more time, and the player will move less per second.

With dt: You multiply by the elapsed time (dt), which compensates for any frame rate fluctuations.
Whether the game runs at 500 FPS, 250 FPS, or 60 FPS, the player's movement speed will remain consistent.

Even though you are using delta time (dt) to ensure frame rate independence, it's still a good idea to set a maximum frame rate using clock.tick(). Here's why:

-> Performance Control: Without frame rate limiting, your game will try to run as fast as possible, which can lead to high CPU or GPU usage.
This can cause unnecessary strain on the system, overheating, and excessive power consumption.
-> Smooth Gameplay: Limiting the frame rate helps prevent the game from running too fast on more powerful hardware,
which can make the game feel unresponsive or too "fast" even if your logic is frame-independent.
-> Consistency: Limiting the frame rate makes the game loop more predictable.
If the game runs at an uncontrollably high frame rate, subtle timing issues may occur, especially in physics calculations or animations.
